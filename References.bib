	abstract = {While risk of outdoor transmission of respiratory viral infections is hypothesized to be low, there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in outdoor compared to indoor settings.We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers indexed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science and preprints in Europe PMC through 12 August 2020 that described cases of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference.Five identified studies found a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred outdoors (\&lt;10\%) and the odds of indoor transmission was very high compared to outdoors (18.7 times; 95\% confidence interval, 6.0–57.9). Five studies described influenza transmission outdoors and 2 adenovirus transmission outdoors. There was high heterogeneity in study quality and individual definitions of outdoor settings, which limited our ability to draw conclusions about outdoor transmission risks. In general, factors such as duration and frequency of personal contact, lack of personal protective equipment, and occasional indoor gathering during a largely outdoor experience were associated with outdoor reports of infection.Existing evidence supports the wide-held belief that risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is lower outdoors but there are significant gaps in our understanding of specific pathways.},

In subsequent testimony before the US Senate, a number reported in our article, “Outdoor Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Respiratory Viruses: A Systematic Review,” was cited that the proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission occurring in outside settings is less than 10\% [2].We are writing to clarify how we arrived at the less than 10\% summary number. Our abstract and results sections state that “five identified studies found a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred outdoors (\&lt;10\%).” Because of the small number of heterogeneous studies we reviewed, as well as their methodological limitations, we could not provide a meta-analytically pooled estimate of the exact proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions that have occurred outdoors or the associated risk.},

Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural municipalities in China (not including Hubei Province). We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and their associated indoor environmental aspects. Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, comprising a total of 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8\% involved three cases, 26.4\% involved four cases, and only 1.6\% involved ten or more cases. Home-based outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9\%), followed by transport-based outbreaks (108; 34.0\%), and many outbreaks occurred in more than one category of venue. All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in indoor environments, which confirm that sharing indoor spaces with one or more infected persons is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.},

	abstract = {Most cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have occurred in close contacts of SARS patients. However, in Beijing, a large proportion of SARS cases occurred in persons without such contact. We conducted a case-control study in Beijing that compared exposures of 94 unlinked, probable SARS patients with those of 281 community-based controls matched for age group and sex. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have chronic medical conditions or to have visited fever clinics (clinics at which possible SARS patients were separated from other patients), eaten outside the home, or taken taxis frequently. The use of masks was strongly protective. Among 31 case-patients for whom convalescent-phase ({\textgreater}21 days) sera were available, 26\% had immunoglobulin G to SARS-associated coronavirus. Our finding that clinical SARS was associated with visits to fever clinics supports Beijing's strategy of closing clinics with poor infection-control measures. Our finding that mask use lowered the risk for disease supports the community's use of this strategy.},
